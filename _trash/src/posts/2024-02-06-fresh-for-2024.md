It has been a few years since i had a blog or even felt like it was something
worthile pursuing. This is the year i got a spark of inspiration to do something
with my personal website again. The robot that's been greeting every visitor for
a few years, can still be [found at its own url](/robot/).

I did make an attempt a few years ago to redesign this site, but that never went
anywhere. Maybe i went a bit overboard and made stuff more complicated than they
needed to be. This time everything just "clicked" and i could feel excitment
about the process again. Something i hadn't felt for a long time (if ever?) when
it comes to web development in general. Perhaps i kept things just simple
enough. In a sense it was a matter of going back to basics.

A lot has happened with CSS in the last decade or so. We have <del>
`light-dark`</del> <ins>(only firefox supports light-dark)</ins>, `color` and
`color-mix` color functions now! Grid and Flexbox for layout are widely
supported, and gone are the days of hacking togheter layout with `float`. One
thing you don't see quite so often these days, are print stylesheets. Did not
use any special CSS Print features, but i made sure it would look alright when
printing or "Save as PDF".

Spent a few hours to design a logo, just needed something interesting to look at
really. The typface for the logo is
[Bahnschrift](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/bahnschrift),
which is based on [DIN 1451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451). DIN 1451
is a typeface defined by the German standards body DIN (_Deutsches Institut für
Normung_). First paragraph from Wikipedia reads as follows.

> DIN 1451 is a sans-serif typeface that is widely used for traffic,
> administrative and technical applications.

Here's what Microsoft has to say about designing Bahnschrift:

> The Microsoft Typography Team began development on a custom version of the
> font in 2013 in response to the ongoing interest in DIN among designers at
> Microsoft. Working from the original spec (design and metrics), a
> Mittelschrift and Engschrift version were created. This version was fairly
> limited in character set and was used internally for a few projects, but
> wasn’t shipped for public use.

> The current version of Bahnschrift began development in 2016. At the time,
> Google, Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft partnered to develop a common
> implementation of variable font technology and Bahnschrift was chosen to
> become Microsoft’s first variable font. To prepare for the transition from
> static to variable, the Bahnschrift source was completely rebuilt from the
> ground up by Aaron Bell of Saja Typeworks and was expanded in weight,
> character set (adding Extended Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic) and manual hinting
> to ensure high quality rendering on a wide range of devices.

Technology-wise i tried to keep everything as simple as possible, in terms of
maintenance and updates. That means a couple of different things.

1. Using a _Static Site Generator_ for generating the website as a set of static
   files that can deployed anywhere. I decided to use [lume](https://lume.land)
   for this, because of the API, plugins and documentation. In terms of build
   speed and performance, lume doesn't not match
   [11ty/eleventy](https://11ty.dev) (trade-offs i guess). My guess is that it
   is
   [related to dom-wasm](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/advanced/jsx_dom/deno_dom#faster-startup),
   but i have not verified if that is the case.

2. Build-less front-end removes a lot of the friction that comes with web
   development. Inlining most of the CSS & JS directly in the HTML. The files
   aren't even fingerprinted, because i'm not sure it's that important for a
   small personal website. Don't optimize prematurely you know?

3. Git-based deployment to CI/CD serverless global CDN pipeline like
   Netlify/Vercel/Cloudflare. I do use Netlify here, but after the whole
   [JAMStack & eleventy debacle](https://www.zachleat.com/web/netlify-and-nextjs/)
   i'm not sure i want to continue using them (They certainly lost some _Open
   Source_ points in my book).

Still needs some polish here and there, but all in all i'm happy about how
things turned out.
