## Questioning Assumptions & best practices in software development

This year has been an enlightening experience for me when it comes to the fundamental practice of software development. 

There are a lot of people with different opinions on how and why this practice should be done a certain way. At the end of the day it comes down to what makes sense in any given situation. Sometimes that means taking another path forward than the one everyone else are walking. You might actually find yourself finally making progress that way. I'm being very general and vague here, so lets clarify things with an example. 

this year, ive been working with a couple of projects in my spare time. this endevour has mostly been a learning experience, a way to hone my skills and fill in any gaps in my knowledge. But at some point it becoms something more than that. now things are more real, and a little more serious and the project should reflect that (i told myself). 

Then what i started doing was adding more complexity by adding packages and by employing the OOP methodology. "Tests! Ah! Gotta have unit tests, let me just require this popular testing framework and get started on that". "This is way too complex and certainly not something i can do myself!". 

Eventually i found myself losing any kind of motivation i had at the beginning of the project. it stopped being fun. instead of developing new features and functionality, more time were spent on configuration of packages, dependency injection setup, weaving together packages and make them behave together, thinking of structure, naming and architecture. creating more abstraction on top of other existing ones to mask/hide the ugly parts. then we have the classes themselves, how should they behave, what should this or that class be responsible for? i think you can see where im going with this. 

at some point i had to stop and ask myself, "what are the fundamental factors must account for, and something i absolutely can't ignore?". "lets see... this being for the web means html, maybe some css, js if i can. then there's the http protocol itself of course!". "so that means status code, headers and the response body!". 

oop is probably necessary whenever there are large teams and stakeholders involved, because you can reason about the code more effectively.

## The Enshitification of the Web

It used to be that whenever you searched for anything with a search engine, you got back search results that were relevant to your search query. Over time it has gotten worse and worse. I'm specifically refering to searching for any kind of topic of information. If your looking for a new shirt, sure... You get thousands of results for shirts.
