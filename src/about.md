# Nice to meet you! My name is Carl.

The domain for this website was registered in the year
<a rel="external" title="Wikipedia entry about the year 2006" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006">2006</a>.

Been creating stuff on and for the web in various forms and capacities for about
15 years.

I do have an interest in technology but i don't think every problem can be
solved with an app.

I think the model of paying rent for our domain names on the web, is somewhat
flawed but perhaps necessary.

I believe having you own place on the web is _still_ way too complicated for the average person, so they end up in data-farming walled garden-silos. That is a shame.

Privacy does not mean anonymity. Personal privacy is a [human right after all](https://privacyinternational.org/explainer/56/what-privacy).

Don't underestimate open source and "view source", it is a great way to learn
new things on the web and that is one of the aspect i like about the web.

Simpler solutions are usually better. Complexity kills.
